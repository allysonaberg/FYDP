    "nylon6": "Nylon was the first synthetic fibre ever produced, and is typically used in swimwear, activewear, and underwear. Its production starts with the extraction of crude oil, and is energy intensive, requiring from 116 up to 170 MJ/kg of nylon. It uses relatively low amounts of water, though more than polyester.",

    "polyester": "With the growth of fast fashion, polyester has become one of the most used textiles in the clothing industry. Polyester is produced from coal and petroleum. Its production uses significantly less water than the production of cotton or other natural fibres, however it uses a significant amount of energy. It requires 125 MJ of energy and emits 14.2 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of polyester.",
    "acrylic": "Acrylic is a synthetic fibre with a very high energy demand; approxmately 210 MJ of energy and 320-543L of water is used to produce each kg of acrylic. It is often used as a cheaper substitute for wool or cashmere, and is typically incorporated into blends with ther materials. Approximately 2.5 million tonnes of acrylic are produced annually, however this number is in decline as its use in fashion has been replaced by polyester.",
    "cotton": "Cotton requires very large quantities of water to grow and process. In the growing stage alone, between 576-4377 L per kg of cotton are used, depending on the region and irrigation, with the global average at 1818 L/kg as of 2005. Cotton is usually bleached, resulting in additional environmental harm. However, cotton requires relatively low amounts of energy to produce, ranging from 90-158 MJ/kg.",
